# Github Repository:
Our Github repository includes personal notebooks, one final notebook, and data sets we used to come to our final conclusion based on which Pittsburgh neighborhood is most ideal for speanding time outside. We individually analyzed registered dogs, public parks, and public art in the personal notebooks then combined all of these factors in our final notebook.
